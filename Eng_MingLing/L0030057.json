The license will be stamped, noting that the drug can not be imported due to deficiency of required documents.  After all documents are submitted and approved, the license will be re-stamped, indicating that the drug can now be imported for sale on the grounds that  full compliance has been met with the DOH’s requirements.\r\n(5)Penalties will be imposed on license holders pursuant to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Acts, if drugs have been produced or imported to sell without validation."
